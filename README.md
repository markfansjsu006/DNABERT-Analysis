# DNABERT Fine-Tuning for Genomic Analysis and Species Classification
### Overview
This project applies transformer-based models (DNABERT) to learn meaningful embeddings from DNA sequences for classification and clustering tasks.

The goal is to analyze DNA sequences using attention-based transformer architectures and visualize how the model learns meaningful biological patterns from genomic data.
These microbial patterns will perform sequence clustering and similarity analysis and then compare them with k-mer methods. 

### Key Skills
- Python  
- PyTorch / Transformers  
- Bioinformatics data processing  
- Unsupervised learning (t-SNE, clustering)

### Impact
- Improves genomic sequence understanding  
- Applicable to species identification and functional genomics

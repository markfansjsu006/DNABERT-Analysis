# DNABERT Fine-Tuning for Genomic Analysis and Species Classification
## Overview
This project applies transformer-based models (DNABERT) to learn meaningful embeddings from DNA sequences for classification and clustering tasks.

The goal is to analyze DNA sequences using attention-based transformer architectures and visualize how the model learns meaningful biological patterns from genomic data.
These microbial patterns will perform sequence clustering and similarity analysis and then compare them with k-mer methods. 

## Technology used
- Python  
- PyTorch / Transformers  
- Bioinformatics data processing  
- Unsupervised learning (t-SNE, clustering)

## What This project Demonstrates:
This project demonstrates the ability to
- Work with large biological datasets
- Apply advanced AI/Transformer models to real-world problems
- Build end-to-end machine learning pipelines
- Analyze and visualize model behavior
- Apply to species identification and functional genomics
- Solve complex classification and clustering problems
